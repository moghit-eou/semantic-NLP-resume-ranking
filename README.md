## üéØ Key Features

*   **Automated Email Classification**: Automatically classifies incoming emails into three categories: `High Priority`, `Low Priority`, and `Job Application` using a supervised machine learning model.
*   **CV Scoring System**: Extracts resumes from `Job Application` emails, analyzes their content, and scores them against a given job description using cosine similarity.
*   **n8n Workflow Orchestration**: The entire process is orchestrated through a powerful and flexible n8n workflow, connecting various services and APIs seamlessly.
*   **NLP-Powered Analysis**: Uses a custom-deployed Word2Vec model to generate vector representations of text, enabling deep semantic understanding of resumes and job descriptions.
*   **Web-Based Visualization**: A Flask-based web application displays the ranked list of candidates, making it easy for recruiters to identify the most suitable applicants.
*   **Modular and Scalable**: The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new models or services.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is composed of two main parts: an **n8n workflow** for process automation and a **Flask web application** for model serving and results visualization.

The workflow is triggered by a new email, classifies it, and if it's a job application, calls the Flask API to score the resume and stores the result in MongoDB. The frontend then fetches the ranked list of candidates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The core of this project is the automated CV evaluation process, detailed in **Chapter 6** of the project report. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. Email Classification and CV Extraction

The n8n workflow begins when a new email arrives.
1.  **Trigger**: A `Gmail Trigger` node detects a new email.
2.  **Classification**: An `HTTP Request` node sends the email body to a deployed classification model.
3.  **Routing**: A `Switch` node routes the workflow based on the classification (`High Priority`, `Low Priority`, or `Job Application`).


### 2. CV Sectioning and Vectorization

For job applications, the system performs the following steps:
1.  **File Extraction**: The attached CV (PDF) is extracted and its raw text is obtained using the `Extract from File` node.
2.  **AI-Powered Sectioning**: An `AI Agent` (using a Large Language Model) structures the raw text into standardized JSON sections: `professional_summary`, `work_experience`, `education`, `skills`, and `others`.

3.  **Vectorization**: Each section of the CV and the job description is sent to a deployed API endpoint, which uses a custom Word2Vec model to return a 100-dimension numerical vector.

### 3. Cosine Similarity and Scoring

The relevance of a candidate is determined by comparing their CV to the job description.
1.  **Similarity Calculation**: The system calculates the **cosine similarity** between the vector of each CV section and the corresponding section of the job description. This measures the semantic similarity, not just keyword matching.

  <br>
  <em>Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors.</em>
</p>

2.  **Weighted Scoring**: Each section's similarity score is multiplied by a predefined weight (e.g., `work_experience` and `skills` are weighted higher).

  <br>
  <em>Empirically determined weights for each section.</em>
</p>

3.  **Final Score**: The weighted scores are summed up to produce a final, global score for the candidate.

### 4. Data Storage and Visualization

1.  **Storage**: The structured CV, along with its detailed and final scores, is saved as a document in a MongoDB database.
2.  **Display**: A user can navigate to the Flask application's `/get_resume` endpoint, which retrieves all candidates from MongoDB, sorts them by their final score in descending order, and displays them on a clean, user-friendly web page.

## üöÄ Installation

To set up this project locally, you will need Python, Docker, and access to an n8n instance.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Python environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string and other necessary credentials.
    ```
    MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    You can run the Flask app directly or use the provided Dockerfile.
    ```bash
    # To run with Flask
    flask run

    # To build and run with Docker
    docker build -t resume-scorer .
    docker run -p 5000:5000 resume-scorer
    ```

## üìñ Usage

1.  **Deploy the Models**: Ensure your classification and vectorization models are deployed (e.g., on Hugging Face Spaces) and that the API endpoints are accessible.
2.  **Configure n8n**: Import the workflow JSON file into your n8n instance. Update the `HTTP Request` nodes with your deployed model URLs and the Flask application's endpoint.
3.  **Start the Process**: Send an email with a CV attached to the monitored Gmail account.
4.  **View Results**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/get_resume` to see the ranked list of candidates.
